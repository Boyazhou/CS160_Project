How do we think and decide? This course, from Professor Nick Chater and Warwick Business School, explores the origins of human rationality and irrationality. Explore our illusion of mental depth Our everyday conception of how our minds work is profoundly misleading. We are victims of an ‘illusion of mental depth’ - we imagine that our thoughts and behaviours arise from hidden motives and beliefs, and that we can understand ourselves by somehow uncovering these hidden forces, whether through therapy, lab experiments or brain scanning. This course will suggest that this conception is not entirely correct, that we’re inventing these motives and beliefs at the very moment of decision. Professor Chater’s central proposition will be that there is no mental depth, that mental depth is an illusion. Understand mystifying aspects of human behaviour This course consists of six weeks of material. Each week we’ll start with a paradox, some mystifying aspect of human behaviour, before looking at insights into it, gained over decades of psychological and behavioural research. You’ll have a chance to try out a classic psychological experiment online. Some of the really exciting things we’ll be looking at are: why we take risks and why we fear them; how people succeed or fail to work with other people successfully; how our behaviour, governed by a plethora of complicated psychological forces, makes sense at all; the theory that we are creating an improvised character and trying to stay in our role; and finally, how we can make society more coherent and create a better world. Meet behavioural science experts from academia, government and industry You’ll learn from Warwick Business School’s leading behavioural science group, as well as a diverse range of people who have thought very deeply in a practical context about the nature of human behaviour. We’ll be talking to Rory Sutherland, ad man and behavioural economics impresario; Tim Harford, the Financial Times undercover columnist; Gus O’Donnell, former head of the Civil Service; and many other senior representatives in high-profile organisations. What previous learners say Over 59,000 learners from across the world have previously joined this course. Below are some examples of the impact it had on them: Absolutely enjoyed every single minute of the course. It was interactive, provoking, educational, illustrative, and persuasive, and would definitely recommend to friends of mine. Thank you [Warwick] and fellow colleagues from this course. - Dilyana Gramadarova Just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the course. It has been very interesting both for the content and the realisation of how much psychology has moved into the mainstream. I was really interested to hear from “behaviourists” in finance, ecology, marketing, the government and the civil service. Thank you. - Christine Chapell We are responsible for our own happiness even though it can be dictated by everyday experiences & our own actions. Governments are required to help us make better choices and therefore live happier lives. Thank you so much for the ‘Mind is Flat’ course, I have enjoyed it immensely.

Managing these supply chains has become more and more a challenge, especially with all modern technologies and todays trends. The 24-hour economy, fast delivery of goods to your home, wanting to have customized products and of course the focus on sustainability are a few of these trends. In this course you will learn why managing supply chains is important and challenging. It is a key activity for both large multi-national companies as well as for small businesses. We’ll find out how to design supply chains that meet future economic, environmental and social requirements, asking questions such as: How did global supply chain become what they are today? How can current information and communication technology (ICT) make supply chains more efficient? Which trends do we need to recognize and cope with? How can you implement sustainable supply chain innovations? And what impact will sensing technologies, such as the use of RFID, have on the supply chain? We will look at examples from the food industry. Also, the building and construction supply chain will be discussed since it has a big impact. One out of three trucks is construction related so innovations applied on this chain can have a huge impact. You’ll be encouraged to apply the knowledge you gain to your own product or industry (or a company and supply chain you’re interested in). You are invited to share your ideas for optimizing your supply chain with other learners.

Aimed at people who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility in any type of organisation, this course will introduce you to reflective practice in people management. “The conventional definition of management is getting work done through people, but real management is developing people through work.” Agha Hasan Abedi Think back to your last few days in the workplace. Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation? As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other. So how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together? The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them. We will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science. We cannot make you a great artist in ten weeks but we can set you on the path. “Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet” Henry Mintzberg Who is this course for? The course is primarily designed for people who are already working and who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility. However, the course does not presume any prior knowledge of management theory. The nature of the organisation in which you work – or hope to work – is immaterial. The depth of thinking and analysis will broadly be at a post-graduate level thus making this an ideal taster course should you be thinking of pursuing a masters degree in business or management in the future. However, you don’t need to have a degree to participate. What might I learn and how might this benefit me? How to manage people and get them engaged. How to get the best out of people. What good management practice is, and how it could be developed sustainably through a process of continuing reflection. Tools and techniques to help you deal more effectively with challenges you may regularly face. What will the learning experience be like and what will be expected of me? The course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, discussions, quizzes and activities based on your experience. You must be willing to think about the ideas we will discuss in the context of your experiences of managing (and being managed) and to reflect on more effective approaches. Indeed, sharing your experiences and reflections with others on the course will help you to get the most out of it.

After introducing the first principles, guest lecturers will cover interdisciplinary aspects of complexity. These are graph theory and networks, emergent behaviour, agent-based modeling, evolutionary dynamics, cellular automata and self-organisation, complexity in history, decision making under uncertainty, heuristics and biases and subsequently leadership and entrepreneurship.

Learn how innovative ideas emerge and become reality You will see that very few innovative ideas are new; the vast majority take something that is already working and improve it. This may be a product, service or process. Those who are closest to the business often have the most innovative ideas. At the end of the course you will have a better understanding of: how to encourage and contribute to innovation in your business; how to turn ideas into reality (for the benefit of the business); the role of people in successful innovation. Explore case studies from major high street retailer, Marks & Spencer Using case studies from the University of Leeds and major high street retailer, Marks & Spencer, we connect theory and practice to demonstrate the importance of innovation in growing and sustaining a business. You will explore a range of important innovations, including the introduction of chilled foods and the development of man-made fibres. You will look at how ideas emerge and develop, and their impact not only on the business, but on how we live our lives today. Through the course you will see that innovation can take many forms and that innovation needs people and organisations with a willingness to embrace change, to wonder “‘what if’,” to challenge the status quo and most importantly to work together. Successful innovations need both determined individuals and a collaborative approach. Join this course to start your journey of innovation.

In Week 3, we will discuss the ethical, legal, and emotional issues associated with the return of stolen cultural objects. Art and antiquities represent our collective cultural identity and crimes against art affect all of us. When an artefact is looted or an artwork is stolen, we have ALL been robbed. We must work together to protect our heritage before it is too late.

People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill. One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding,” this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression. So if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this free online course extremely useful.

We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write. The aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs. Each week we’ll start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound. You’ll learn how to interact with them to change their behaviour, creating increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques. Learn with professional artists and designers We will also look at how leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them. The course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as: Can a computer be independently creative? Who is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program? How is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology? Does the computer bring anything that is really new to art? If you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.

No-one has the money or resources to provide them all, so how do we decide which ones to fund? One factor which can help inform these decisions is to compare the costs and benefits of treatments. Costs are fairly straightforward to calculate, but what about benefits? How do we know which treatments help patients most? And how do we measure and value these benefits? Understand Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Quality Adjusted Life Years This free online course will introduce you to health outcomes and explain how they can be measured and valued, to make more informed decisions about where to spend our limited healthcare budgets. We’ll look at two different types of measures, asking how they’re developed and calculated, and how they’re used by decision makers in practice: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs): which are measures completed by the patients themselves, about their health, symptoms, functioning, well-being or satisfaction with treatment. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs): which compare the benefits of different treatment options, based on the quality and quantity of life they yield. Learn and debate with specialists in health economics Over 3 weeks, you’ll learn with Dr Katherine Stevens and other specialists from the School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield. You’ll also get to share your experiences and debate the key issues with other learners. Should it be patients or the general population who value our health? Or someone else? And should we value children’s health differently? This course will help you understand how and why choices about drugs and treatments have been made. It may inspire you to think about a career in healthcare, local decision making or academia.

This discovery and evaluation is done in a variety of ways, which collectively we call “research.” And research that involves people, we call “clinical research.” This free online course is all about this process of discovery and how it is used to improve healthcare. Together, we will look in detail at why we do research and how we do it. We will bring this to life through cases studies covering topics such as how research is helping to find new ways of treating and providing care for some of the major diseases including cancer and dementia. Through the course we will focus on the important ethical questions raised by clinical research and take a look into the future. Over four weeks, we will speak to different members of a research team, including academics and clinicians from the National Institute of Health Research and the University of Leeds.

Assessing the reasons we are given to do or believe these things calls upon us to think critically and logically. Improve your logical and critical thinking skills Even though we’re called upon to use our critical and logical thinking skills all the time, most of us are not that good at it. This free online course aims to help you develop and improve these skills. You’ll learn how to: identify and avoid common thinking mistakes that lead to the formation of bad beliefs; recognise, reconstruct and evaluate arguments; use basic logical tools to analyse arguments; and apply those tools in areas including science, moral theories and law. Associate Professor Tim Dare and Dr Patrick Girard from the University of Auckland take us on an informative and engaging eight week journey through the worlds of logical and critical thinking helping us to avoid these common obstacles and fallacies and improve our logical and critical thinking skills. Throughout the course, Tim and Patrick provide videos, articles, and assignments to lead us through the thickets of logical and critical thinking. We will spend the first half of the course exploring key concepts in logical and critical thinking. In the second half of the course, we will apply those concepts in familiar areas, to help you develop practical and useful logical and critical thinking skills. We begin, in the first week, with an introduction to logical and critical thinking and common obstacles and fallacies. In week two Patrick introduces arguments. We learn to identify premises and conclusions – components of a good argument – and by the end of this week we’ll be able to construct an argument in standard form. In week three we will learn how to distinguish between deductive and non-deductive arguments and about validity, invalidity, strength and weakness. In week four we examine good and bad arguments in more detail, learning how to tell when an argument is sound or cogent, and how to evaluate an argument. Weeks five to seven examine three familiar areas – science, law, and morality – that call upon our logical and critical thinking skills in ways appropriate to the particular demands of those areas. Finally in week eight we will apply the lessons of the course to an argument “in the wild”, seeing how the skills we have developed over our eight-week journey can be used in our own lives. By the end of the course, you will have acquired the basic skills to assess arguments logically and critically, and so to be in a better situation to own the reasons for your beliefs.

Through case studies - ranging from hip implants to facial transplants to lab-grown organs - we’ll answer questions such as: What is 3D printing and how did it come about? Is it really possible to print structures that incorporate both living and artificial components? How long before we can print whole body organs for transplants? What is possible right now, and what will be possible in 20 and 50 years’ time? And what are the limitations of this technology? This course will also equip and encourage you to become part of the story. You’ll be given guided opportunities to not only investigate the 3D printing facilities available to you, but to also design, potentially print and share your creations with your fellow learners.', 'https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/bioprinting', '//view.vzaar.com/4894894/video', '2015-11-30', 21, 'https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e6/3f/regular_e63f6908-c6bc-4bc2-9059-d18064cac286.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e6/3f/regular_e63f6908-c6bc-4bc2-9059-d18064cac286.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e6/3f/regular_e63f6908-c6bc-4bc2-9059-d18064cac286.jpg', 'Health and Psychology', 'www.futurelearn.com', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Logo for Australian Institute for Innovative Materials, University of Wollongong', '2015-11-21 14:11:35'),

Learners wishing to qualify for CPD credit will be required to purchase a Statement of Participation as evidence of having completed the course. Explore the rise of genomic medicine Over the last decade, the landscape of genomic medicine has been revolutionised by next generation sequencing technologies. In the past, genetic testing was limited to sequencing one gene at a time. However, next generation sequencing technologies permit the parallel sequencing of many or all genes. While these new technologies have greatly enhanced the chances of diagnosis for rare conditions; are beginning to provide a real chance of personalised medicine; and, in time, are likely to improve our understanding and treatment of complex disease, they are also associated with a number of challenges. These challenges include a much greater chance of identifying genomic variants, the significance of which can be uncertain; the identification of incidental findings; genomic privacy; and the storage and use of big data sets. In this new genomic era, it is essential that healthcare professionals understand the power and all the challenges associated with the information generated by these new multiple parallel sequencing technologies, in order to make appropriate referrals and evidence-based management decisions. Discover the potential of genetics in healthcare This course will give you an awareness of genomic technologies and the data they generate. With ready access to genomic data promised by NHS transformational initiatives such as the 100,000 Genomes Project, genomic data will be integral to all sectors of medicine and will be used in the prevention, diagnosis and personalised treatment of human disease. During this course, you will learn how to utilise these genomic results for patient benefit and without compromising patient safety. Learn with experts in clinical genetics and education The course draws on the experience of experts in clinical genetics and education at St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, St George’s, University of London, and the Genomics Education Programme from Health Education England. St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is a founding member of the Genomics Network Alliance, recognised by NHS England as a Genomic Medicine Centre. Understand the role of clinical geneticists As clinical geneticists, who undertake diagnosis and care of patients with genetic conditions on a regular basis, the course educators are able to explain the role of novel technologies, and explore how the technologies - and the data they generate - are relevant to clinical practice both now and in the future. The educators are also very familiar with the challenges associated with the use of genomic technologies and will discuss these with you during the course. In addition, they bring with them a range of experience and skills outside of clinical genetics, with active involvement in research projects using next generation sequencing technologies, and postgraduate degrees in medical education, and medical ethics and law.

How do they work?', 'This course is designed for anyone who has ever wondered how the drugs in their medicine cabinet were found in the first place and how they ended up as pills in a bottle. Where do drugs come from? We’ll start by reflecting on the nature of medicines and look at the history of some everyday drugs that have been taken by humans for centuries. This will show us that many commonly used drugs were found somewhat accidentally - and often without any understanding of the science behind how they worked. Over time, this apparently random process has been refined and improved, so we’ll go on to consider recent advances in identifying potential drugs. How do drugs go from laboratory to medicine? Finding a molecule that has the potential to act as a drug is not the end of the process. The critical questions then are: how do we get the drug into the body? how much needs to be taken? and will it be safe enough as well as effective? What’s your experience?

Mindfulness might be the solution. Mindfulness is essentially about being more aware and awake in every moment of your life. It is about intentionally paying attention to each moment, being fully engaged in whatever is happening around and within you, with an attitude of friendliness and compassion. Research shows that when we are not deliberately paying attention to something, our brain clicks off into default mode, which is characterised by mind wandering, operating on “autopilot,” dwelling on the past, and worrying about judgment, criticism and the future. The result can be increased stress and anxiety, poor communication, and impaired academic and occupational functioning. Learn mindfulness techniques to reduce stress and improve performance Mindfulness can help you unhook from these unproductive thought patterns and behaviours, and engage more fully with work and leisure time. This practical six-week course explores the science, practice and philosophy of mindfulness. You will learn how to incorporate mindfulness practices into your life to reduce stress, improve mental health, and enhance your personal and professional life. You will understand formal mindfulness meditation practices, as well as the informal practice of being mindful in daily life to learn - to pay attention to the present moment instead of worrying, dwelling in the past or reacting to what is happening. You will also develop an attitude of friendliness and compassion toward yourself, as opposed to self-criticism. These mindfulness-based approaches have been found to improve executive functioning, learning and memory, performance, communication, empathy, and mental and physical health. Learn from experienced mindfulness practitioners Dr Craig Hassed is a General Practitioner and Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, and the Mindfulness Coordinator at Monash University. Craig is a regular speaker in Australia and internationally on the application of mindfulness for health and wellbeing. Craig has authored nine books, including Mindful Learning with Dr Richard Chambers. Dr Richard Chambers is a clinical psychologist specialising in mindfulness-based therapies.

Seasonal influenza returns each winter, killing up to half a million people in bad years and causing much misery. Pandemic influenza, by contrast, is rare - having occurred only a handful of times in the last century - and far worse than seasonal flu, often killing many millions across the world. The worst pandemic of all, the “Spanish Flu” of 1918, killed over twice as many people as the First World War - some estimates are even higher. Since 1918, our understanding of influenza virus has come a long way. We can now trace how the pandemics of the last hundred years originated in bird flu and swine flu, and we can model the evolution of the virus from year to year, aiding vaccine design. We also have some anti-viral drugs that can be used in emergencies, and we understand more about how flu is transmitted and possible ways to prevent its spread. In this free online course, we will cover everything from the history of influenza to modern laboratory diagnostics and vaccination. You’ll learn about the annual cycle that brings seasonal flu to our shores every winter, and also how avian and pig flus can contribute to the emergence of new pandemic strains of flu.

It aims to build bridges between traditionally antagonistic approaches to understanding the mind. What is a mind? This question has perplexed philosophers, scientists, historians and ordinary people across time and cultures. While advances in the medical understanding of how the brain functions can shed light on neurological functions and disorders, the essential question of what the mind is speaks to a different problem. This problem cannot be answered by a purely scientific understanding of the brain, nor by a purely philosophical or psychological approach. Many disciplines have attempted to address the question’, resulting in multiple and sometimes antithetical answers. New understandings of the mind On this course, Professor Mark Solms, Chair of Neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town, will adopt a multidisciplinary approach. He will bring in perspectives from a range of disciplines, to explore four specific aspects of the mind- subjectivity, intentionality, consciousness and agency. Together, these will help us think about the fundamental questions: what it is to be a mind, why we have a mind and what it feels like to have a mind.

This fact places a considerable ethical weight on military practitioners as well as the civilian decision-makers who authorize military missions. The military profession is also unique in having a dedicated ethical framework associated with it, Just War Theory. This defines the conditions for when it is justified for a party to resort to war, the requirements for ethical conduct within the bounds of a war or armed conflict, and the conditions for a just ending to war. The ethical challenges that military professionals face do not, however, begin and end with the use of force.

He will explore how and why the longbow was used at Agincourt with such devastating effect. Finally, we will visit the battlefield itself, to examine what remains at Agincourt today. You will learn about the modern site of the battle and how scientific historical research can transform our understanding of an event which took place 600 years ago. The course will coincide with the anniversary of the battle and will feature contributions from a range of experts on Agincourt.

How does political change, violence, total war, affect life in its most basic ways? Looking at Ireland through war and revolution, this course considers these and other questions about Irish life between 1912 and 1923. The course looks beyond the familiar names and the famous faces – the traditional histories can tell us about them. Instead, it explores how the events that shaped the nature of modern Ireland - the Great War, the Easter Rising, the Irish war of independence and civil war - were experienced by the people who lived through them or in spite of them. Through videos, assignments and discussions, through innovative approaches, this course introduces you to the history of Ireland in one of its most tumultuous periods. Considering the choices of those who fought in all sorts of ways for all sorts of causes, looking at the continuities of everyday life, this course allows us to question our broader understanding of these years. Looking at the intricate and complex tapestry of lives lived, often in the midst of chaos, we might begin to ask different questions of these years. Do we understand war better if we consider the motivations that took a single soldier to the front, whether that front was in Flanders or Dublin? Does our sense of the entire period change when we examine general social and cultural trends or when we investigate their effect on private lives?

Aviation evolved rapidly during WW1, with modern and more effective aircraft soon replacing the very basic machines that took to the skies in 1914. We’ll look at the innovations that turned the aeroplane into a machine of war and how British factories developed to supply the Western Front with aircraft and ammunition. We’ll examine how the aeroplane became commercially viable, with passenger and mail routes starting to appear, and how the government tried - and failed - to regulate the aviation industry.

In this free online course, a team of scholars from the University of Leicester address a broad set of themes about the England Richard would have inhabited in the 15th century and look back at his rediscovery and reinterment. Explore the Wars of the Roses The political scene in the 15th century was dominated by savage dynastic warfare – the Wars of the Roses - in which allegiances and power shifted among an aristocratic clique, with devastating outcomes. The century also saw the abandonment of many villages through general population decline, and a shift towards greater use of the land for pasture farming. But demand for labour meant that the prosperity of working people rose, and towards the end of the century, the introduction of printing transformed access to literacy and books. Each week, we’ll address a different perspective of this period: medieval warfare the lives of peasants and farmers food and culture death and commemoration reading and the introduction of printing. The rediscovery and reinterment of Richard III We’ll look at how historians and archaeologists have reconstructed Richard’s road to Bosworth - the battle in which he died - and how one of England’s most famous kings came to be buried in Leicester. This will help you understand Richard III’s reinterment, as his remains were taken to Bosworth, through the villages connected with his last battle, and finally laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral in March 2015.

Understanding the history and current reality behind Sino-Korean relations - countries long-described as being as close yet as different as “lips and teeth” - opens up a window onto perhaps the key geopolitical transformation of the present age. This free online course from Yonsei University in Seoul will cover lot of ground chronologically, focussing on watershed moments that include: the Imjin War (1592-1598); the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895); the Korean War (1950-1953); and the end of the Cold War (1991). We will then turn our historical gaze to the present, focusing on the current leaders of China, and North and South Korea. We will look at the ways in which the extraordinary family histories of Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un and Park Geun-hye embody the complex relationship between lips and teeth.

The war began in the Balkans, but it soon spread to become a European conflict, and developed into a world war. It was a war of unprecedented scale and brutality, with countless casualties. It also left a poisonous legacy for the 20th century and beyond, and many of the issues that were left unresolved in 1918 would lead to another world war in 1939. 1914-1918 was a period in history that has proved provocative and culturally resonant for the last hundred years. On this free online course, you will study the subject of physical and mental trauma, its treatments and its representation. You will focus not only on the trauma experienced by combatants but also the effects of World War 1 on civilian populations. Over three weeks, you will discover just how devastating the effects of World War 1 were in terms of casualties across the many combatant nations, and look in depth at the problem of “shell shock” and how deeply it affected the lives of those who lived through it. You will also develop the skills to carry out your own independent research. The war was not only experienced on the battlefield, however, and you’ll explore the many and varied ways in which civilians’ lives were affected by it. For example, in the way combatant casualties affected the lives of loved ones who were left behind. Finally, you will look at how the trauma of World War 1 has been depicted in art and literature, and see what has been learned from the past in the modern day treatment of combat stress reactions and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Brave men led to their deaths by stupid officers? A war of trenches, mud and barbed wire in which there was no victor? In this short, free online course, we offer you the opportunity to uncover both the mechanics and the memory of the Great War. Focusing on the Western Front, the most important and bloody theatre of the war, we will examine how the Allied armies experienced a ‘learning curve’. We will see how they integrated new training, techniques and technologies, to end the stalemate of trench warfare, defeat the German invader and liberate Belgium and northern France from four hard years of military occupation. The course compares and contrasts the reality of the First World War - a costly and wasteful conflict, but one that ended in a decisive victory over German aggression - with our memory of it today, a war that was both senseless and ineffective. Throughout, we will focus on the experiences of soldiers in the British, French, German and American armies, as these formed the majority of soldiers on the Western Front. This includes soldiers from the British and French empires, including Australian, Canadian, Indian, New Zealand, Algerian, Moroccan and West African soldiers. You will learn with John Connor, one of Australia’s leading military historians, and a team of international historians. They will draw on the latest historical research to offer new insights and engage with old myths, helping you understand a conflict that, despite occurring a century ago, still resonates with people today. The course is presented in three parts: Part 1: An overview of the Great War. We concentrate on the conflict on the Western Front, and explore the development of an unprecedented type of combat, trench warfare. Part 2: The ‘learning curve’. In this section we compare how the British, French and German armies attempted to end the stalemate of trench warfare by developing new technology, training and tactics. Part 3: Remembering the First World War. We explore how the social and political landscape has shaped and changed the memory of the War over the last century, and how art, poetry and novels have contributed to that understanding.

Forming a coalition to defeat Napoleon We will explain why Europe had been at war almost continuously since 1793; how a peace settlement in 1814 had followed the abdication of Napoleon as Emperor of the French; and how further negotiations were under way at the Congress of Vienna when Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815. The process of gathering military support and a legal basis for a further campaign against Napoleon will be explored, as well as the ways in which a coalition of Allied Powers assembled an army, led by the Duke of Wellington, to fight the French. We will examine sources from the Battle of Waterloo itself — from official despatches to the voice of the individual soldier — and consider the ways in which different interpretations arise, before discussing the immediate consequences of the battle and the peace settlement that followed. The course will conclude by examining the longer-term place of Waterloo and Wellington in commemoration and memory, the arts and popular culture, and the connections that were made to nineteenth-century ideas of heroism, nationality and identity.

The course will coincide with Remembrance Day on 11th November, and suggests new and more inclusive ways of remembering. Go on a journey across the battlefields of Gallipoli and the Western Front on which the war was fought and into the homes of the ordinary people who suffered it. The 100 stories distil the experience of the Great War. Amongst the cast of the 100 stories are not just soldiers, sailors, airmen and nurses, but parents who lost their sons, wives who struggled with shell-shocked husbands, children who never knew their fathers. The themes these stories explore - grief and suffering, hope, anguish and loss - are universal. They are told in a language everyone can understand and are based on archives only just opened to historians. Hear from leading historians in the field, and together debate the meanings of the stories. Each week we’ll examine a different topic, including the physical and psychological wounds of war - shell shock, disability and trauma; women’s mobilisation both at home and in the field; and what we’ve called ‘the other Anzac’: indigenous soldiers too often ignored in our history. We’ll examine grief and mourning; protest and repatriation, the politics of war and its intensely personal dimensions. Learn how to research your own stories.

Hadrian’s Wall stretches over 73 miles (117 km), from coast to coast in what is now Northern England. The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire’s provinces, Hadrian’s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians. This six week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian’s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers’ families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs. Drawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering: the factors that determine the survival of evidence the different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation the planning of archaeological projects excavation techniques and the detailed study of structures and artefacts.

We’ll analyse this period of Chinese history through the eyes of travellers, discoverers and missionaries who wrote about China from the 13th to the 17th century. These will include Marco Polo - not the first European to discover China, but the first to chronicle his time there in detail - and later Portuguese settlers, such as Galeote Pereira. We’ll also take advantage of Chinese and European illustrated sources, like scrolls, paintings and maps, to give a more accurate picture of how China really was at each time. Understand how Europe constructed the image of China Through these sources, we’ll see how Europeans constructed a highly positive image of China that would persist until the 18th century. What these Western travellers saw, what they didn’t see, what they choose not to tell and what they invented - that’s the story that we will unravel in this course.', 'https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/european-discovery-china', '//view.vzaar.com/3990564/video', '2015-11-30', 21, 'https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/71/04/regular_7104226d-9edf-44b2-8bb4-956bebc969aa.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/71/04/regular_7104226d-9edf-44b2-8bb4-956bebc969aa.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/71/04/regular_7104226d-9edf-44b2-8bb4-956bebc969aa.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/71/04/regular_7104226d-9edf-44b2-8bb4-956bebc969aa.jpg', 'History', 'www.futurelearn.com', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Pompeu Fabra', '2015-11-21 14:13:09'),

People are increasingly bombarded by dramatic and at times disturbing headlines. Yet general knowledge of Muslims and their faith can be poor. There is consequently a need for a balanced and well-informed understanding of the current debates around this internationally significant topic. This course uses Britain as a case study to shed light on wider issues relating to the growth of Islamic communities across the culturally Christian and increasingly secularised Western World. This MOOC reflects the work of the Islam-UK Centre at Cardiff University, and the research that we have conducted over the last decade. This means that we focus in this course upon the everyday lives of Muslims in Britain, as opposed to the activities of the very small minority of Muslims who engage in terrorist activities. Later in the course, we will help you to access material on this topic if you are interested Topics include: Islamic Practice An outline of Islamic practices and beliefs plus an introduction to the different viewpoints within Islam. History of Islam in Britain An exploration of the longstanding associations between Islam and Britain, including Islamic influences on British society and the well-established connections between Britain and the countries from which many British Muslims originally hailed. Settlement Patterns The origins and makeup of today’s British Muslim communities. Cultural Diversity Confronting the ‘myth’ of a homogenous Muslim community through an exploration of the various religious and cultural influences that characterise and inform Muslim communities in Britain today. Contemporary Debates An examination of how the above topics feed into the contemporary debates and what the future might hold. Given current debates about multiculturalism, integration, and the spectre of fundamentalism, this course will appeal to a wide audience not only in Britain but far beyond.

The most influential developments have been in the area of DNA profiling, and its forensic applications for both identifying perpetrators and exonerating the innocent. Although there have been some extraordinary victories for the forensic science community in recent years, there has also been scepticism about the infallibility of some forensic science practices, and the interpretation of physical evidence in the courtroom. This free online course begins by introducing you to the historical context of forensic science and how science is used by the police during criminal investigations. We will then explore some of the implications that these forensic techniques have on the criminal justice system, such as controversies surrounding biometric databases, the portrayal of forensic science in popular media (“the CSI effect”), and how forensic science is used in the courtroom. Finally, we will consider what the future of forensic science looks like and where the discipline may be heading in the years to come.', 'https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/forensic-crim-justice', '//view.vzaar.com/2493477/video', '2015-11-30', 28, 'https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/94/92/regular_9492d7b6-a08b-4d56-a565-3248a1872b53.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/94/92/regular_9492d7b6-a08b-4d56-a565-3248a1872b53.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/94/92/regular_9492d7b6-a08b-4d56-a565-3248a1872b53.jpg', 'Law', 'www.futurelearn.com', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of Leicester', '2015-11-21 14:15:23'),

Different people place different values on nature. For example, some see it as something we should conserve for future generations, others as a resource of financial value to be exploited. Policies about managing nature should be economically and environmentally sound, but they also need to be formulated with social fairness if they are to be sustainable. Inevitably, when there are so many different values, conflicts occur and worlds collide. We start the course by examining a number of basic principles and then apply them to two case studies. The first case study looks at a range of classic examples, and the second takes the form of a debate centred on our own research. The basic principles can be applied in many different contexts and the case studies are drawn from all over the world, making the course suitable for participants from a wide range of countries and backgrounds.

Its rapid rise has not been without controversy, however. Earth tremors, surface and groundwater contamination, and the effects of fracking on human and animal health are all high profile concerns. During this four-week course, we’ll study the politics, economics, and science of shale gas. We’ll examine how shale gas was formed, and how we extract it through hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’. We will look at the impact of shale gas on energy markets and energy security. We then move on to the environmental politics of shale. What are the local effects in terms of water contamination, seismic activity, and air pollution? What are the global effects? Does shale gas offer a ‘bridge’ to a low-carbon future, or would we be walking the plank? Finally we look at the question of what the public thinks, an area where the University of Nottingham has particular expertise, having run a public opinion survey on shale gas since 2012. Why are the US and UK experiences so different? What do the public think of allowing unconventional gas to be developed?

This course will focus on threats to global food security and the challenges that need to be overcome, in order to maintain healthy and sustainable food supplies. The course will begin by looking at global food insecurity and the potential consequences for human health. Examining links between food insecurity and the rising tide of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases around the globe, it will demonstrate how the issue is particularly relevant in the developed world. It will continue on to examine threats to global food security posed by parasites, which undermine the health of animals and plants, damaging food production systems globally. Having considered threats to global food security the course will look at approaches to sustaining healthy agri-food systems such as the benefits of applied genetics for fisheries management and aquaculture. The course will conclude by considering societal concerns around animal welfare, as pressure builds to increase production intensity whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Our central concern is ‘How we will feed an extra two billion people by the middle of this century?’ Focussing both on UK agriculture and on food supply chains in other parts of the world, we will examine how food has shaped our environmental and social landscapes. We will see that, while everyone would agree that food security is ‘a good thing’, ideas about what it means in practice and how it should be achieved vary tremendously. Proposed developments to address global food insecurity range from technological inventions in the efficacy of large-scale agriculture through social and cultural innovations in local food production and consumption. You’ll be exploring a number of topics that address many issues including: Is food security really just about food? Should we have concerns about health, social justice, environmental degradation and cultural diversity? What is the role of technology and innovation in promoting food security? And much more. In the final week we explore the big picture by considering food systems and food chains as a whole. Using examples from some of the case studies that we’ve explored, we consider the relationships between production and consumption and question whether particular kinds of agriculture are linked to particular diets and patterns of consumption. We will explore the role of the retailer and the consumer in more detail as we ask what it means to enjoy a safe, healthy, sustainable diet.

You’ll see examples of active research in this field, and discover why humanities research is vital to understanding and confronting contemporary environmental challenges, such as climate change and global biodiversity loss. “Remake” your ideas about nature The Environmental Humanities places scientific knowledge in dialogue with the key concerns of the humanities: how people think, feel, protest, vote and create. Our main aim in this course is to consider and create new narratives about how humans and the environment relate to one another. We’ll begin this course by identifying historical ways of thinking about the environment. Through a range of examples, we’ll illustrate how “nature” is a human invention. We’ll then look at how the role of humans has been conceptualised in opposition to notions of nature, and assert that we were never at the centre, nor in control of the environment. Having questioned these common “modernist” conceptions about nature, we’ll examine some of the ways in which the natural world is being “remade,” both discursively (in the way we write, speak and think about it) and materially (for instance, in the alteration of DNA and the wholesale transformation of ecosystems). Finally, we’ll ask you to join us in creating new narratives about nature that demonstrate greater care and concern. Explore research methods and real-world environmental concerns Leading experts from the Environmental Humanities programme at UNSW Australia’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences will introduce you to their research in this innovative and interdisciplinary field. By the end of this course you will: understand why the Environmental Humanities is critical to environmental problem-solving in this age of global environmental crisis; have a clear idea of a range of research methods in the Environmental Humanities; be aware of opportunities and challenges in this area, and how these relate to global environmental concerns; and develop experience in using storytelling to envision new environmental paradigms and ways forward.', 'https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature', '', '2016-01-11', 35, 'https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/fa/f0/regular_faf0e28b-3637-46ef-b2db-0b68ff609a67.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/fa/f0/regular_faf0e28b-3637-46ef-b2db-0b68ff609a67.jpg, https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/fa/f0/regular_faf0e28b-3637-46ef-b2db-0b68ff609a67.jpg', 'Nature and Environment', 'www.futurelearn.com', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of New South Wales', '2015-11-21 14:18:24'),

The energy system has been continually changing, as the economy and technology progress. Today, energy systems are confronted with pressing global challenges: climate protection; economic and social development; poverty eradication; adequate food production; health for all; and the conservation of ecosystems, peace and security. A major transformation – an energy transition - is required to address these challenges. Take a multidisciplinary approach to energy transition Energy transition, however, is not a simple question with straightforward solutions. Instead, it must consider and balance technological, legal, economic, spatial and social aspects. On this free online course, we will take this multidisciplinary approach, to examine the energy transition question from each of these perspectives. We will provide you with the framework and methods to analyse the question yourself. We will start by introducing global energy and sustainability issues, and possible scenarios in the first week. To facilitate and realise changes in energy systems, technology and innovation plays an important role. This will be discussed in Week 2. In Weeks 3 and 4, we will analyse legal and economic considerations at regional and country levels. When country-level decisions are being implemented, spatial planning and social acceptance come into the picture. In Weeks 5 and 6, we will discuss how communities and individuals perceive energy transitions and interact with policies. Analyse energy transition in your own country In the final week, you will use the knowledge and skills you will have acquired from this course, to analyse the energy transition question in your own country.

Alarmingly, the combined impacts of rapid population growth and climate change are now posing a severe threat to the liveability and resilience of our cities. However, it’s possible to design water systems that provide cities with the capacity to cope with these threats. So-called “water sensitive urban design” creates water sensitive cities that enhance and protect the health of watercourses and wetlands; mitigate flood risk and damage; and create public spaces that harvest, clean and recycle water. This approach poses complex planning and urban design challenges. And it requires solutions that address equally complex and interrelated considerations, such as social, environmental, political, economic, planning and engineering disciplines. In this free online course, you’ll hear from leading researchers and thought-leaders in Australia and internationally about key actions in delivering water sensitive cities. You’ll consider and discuss the latest solutions and concepts on urban design and modelling, climate change adaptation, behaviour change, and social and government engagement. Specifically, you’ll consider: the emerging challenges facing our cities how water sensitive cities can be the driver for more resilient cities how water can be managed in our cities to improve their liveability the potential for stormwater, urban aquatic systems, and green infrastructure to improve the urban climate how changes in human behaviour and institutions can complement and assist transitions to water sensitive cities.

We’ve all heard about them, but how many of us know what makes a robot a robot? And can anyone get a robot to do a particular task? An introduction to robotics If you’d like to find out more, but are worried that you don’t have Hawking’s brain or an advanced qualification in cybernetics, this four week, free online course is for you. We’re not planning to sit you down with a soldering iron, but we will introduce you to the basics of robot design through a series of simulations that will have you test driving an Eric – our very own University of Reading mobile robot. How far back does Robot history go? We’ll start by looking at some of the earliest, real and fictional robots ever invented: from musical automata in 13th century Iraq to Leonardo da Vinci’s mechanical lion; from the early 20th century science fiction of “Metropolis” and Asimov to the first Mars lander in 1996. Look inside a mobile robot After dipping into robot history, you’ll be ready to get more hands on. Our experts will guide you through the basics. Using a combination of videos, animations, screencasts, articles, discussions and quizzes, you’ll explore the internals of mobile robots. You’ll find out about the individual components of robot anatomy (the mechanics, electronics and computer “brain”) and how they relate to one another and to the sensors - the parts that enable the machine to perceive its surroundings. Next, you’ll tackle the motors: how do you control your robot to help it avoid obstacles, head in the right direction and travel at an optimum speed? A “thinking” machine? In the final week, you’ll investigate the thought-provoking topic of robot behaviour. What can we learn about developing robots based on what we know about living systems? If we introduce a simple “brain”, what influence does this have on the robot’s behaviour? How is a robot’s movement specified by what it perceives? Can we create robots with basic instincts, and the ability to learn and co-operate with one another? Come and join us for this action-packed course.

According to some, conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about. Our point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students. In the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest. The third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. During the fourth week, we will analyze case studies like conflicts over abortion policies in the United States and the rise of IS in the Middle East. In week five, we will shift our attention to the role of religion in peace building and reconciliation. The course concludes with an assignment in which you will apply your newly acquired analytical tools to write a briefing paper on the role of religion in a specific conflict situation of your own choice.

More often than not, the data are presented to bolster a (sometimes contentious) claim, so the ability to read such information with confidence is an increasingly important skill for both modern citizens and those studying the social sciences. What do social statistics and economic data really reveal? In this free online course, we’ll look at ways of cutting through the confusion to decide what numbers reveal, and when and why they (sometimes deliberately) mislead. We’ll ask: How do we make sense of all these numbers? How can we decide which ones to trust and which to doubt? And how do we know which might reveal important trends and which are less dramatic than they sound? By the end of the course, you will have improved your data literacy skills; developed an understanding of how social statistics are created and used; and become a more critical consumer and user of social and economic data.
